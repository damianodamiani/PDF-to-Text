This code searches only through the specified directory for PDF files, extracts their text, and saves them as individual text files in the specified output directory. 

### PDF-to-Text-B

### PDF-to-Text-C
This code searches through the specified directory and all its subdirectories for PDF files, extracts their text, and saves them as individual text files in the specified output directory. 

### PDF-to-Text-D
This code searches through the specified directory and all its subdirectories for PDF files, extracts their text, aand combines it to save it as one text files in the specified output directory. 

## How to use

### PDF-to-Text-A
1. Open the Python script in your code editor.
2. In `pdf_directory = '/path/to/pdf/files'`  replace /path/to/pdf/files with the actual directory path.
3. In `output_directory = '/path/to/output/directory'`  replace /path/to/output/directory with the desired output directory path.
4. Save the script and you're ready to go. 
### PDF-to-Text-B
1. Open the Python script in your code editor.
2. In `pdf_directory = '/path/to/pdf/files'`  replace /path/to/pdf/files with the actual directory path.
3. In `output_directory = '/path/to/output/directory'`  replace /path/to/output/directory with the desired output directory path.
4. Rename the output file `'combined_text.txt'` as desired.
5. Save the script and you're ready to go. 
### PDF-to-Text-C
1. Open the Python script in your code editor.
2. In `pdf_directory = '/path/to/pdf/files'`  replace /path/to/pdf/files with the actual directory path.
3. In `output_directory = '/path/to/output/directory'`  replace /path/to/output/directory with the desired output directory path.
4. Save the script and you're ready to go.
### PDF-to-Text-D
1. Open the Python script in your code editor.
2. In `pdf_directory = '/path/to/pdf/files'`  replace /path/to/pdf/files with the actual directory path.
3. In `output_directory = '/path/to/output/directory'`  replace /path/to/output/directory with the desired output directory path.
4. In `combined_text_file_name = 'combined_text.txt'`  rename the output file as desired.
6. Save the script and you're ready to go.
